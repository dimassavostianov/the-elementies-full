Afronik font is an Afrikan themed display font. It is created strictly using straight lines and edges with the exception of the Soft version of the font. To make it unique, it has an Opentype feature (Discretionary Ligatures) that when turned on, convert the font into a cool looking pattern like feel. The font is designed primarily for Display purposes thus it will look great on Poster Headlines, Logos, Billboards etc. 

Many thanks to Edwin Jaulani for the never ending motivation & Inspiration!!!!
